# Hello siddhant

Welcome to Lockbook! This is an example note to help you get started with our note editor. You can keep it to use as a cheat sheet or delete it anytime.

Lockbook uses Markdown, a lightweight language for formatting plain text. You can use all our supported formatting just by typing. Hereâ€™s how it works:

# This is a heading

## This is a smaller heading

### This is an even smaller heading

###### Headings have 6 levels

For italic, use single *asterisks* or _underscores_.

For bold, use double **asterisks** or __underscores__.

For inline code, use single `backticks`

For code blocks, use
```
triple
backticks
```

>For block quotes,
use a greater-than sign

Bulleted list items
* start
* with
* asterisks
- or
- hyphens
+ or
+ plus
+ signs

Numbered list items
1. start
2. with
3. numbers
4. and
5. periods
