Project - Given a directory, figure out all the links in the directory, identify any links, test those links to see if they are valid or return 404, and try to do that concurrently

Point all files recursively and try to find anything that resembles a link and test 
any txt document

Try to do as much of this in parallel - example testing a link could take time so dont do it sequentially, so distrubute it.
